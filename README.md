## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in analizing the airbnb dataset of Boston.
Therefore, I wanted to get a deeper insight about the following questions:

Question 1: How the prices for AirBNB stays fluctuated in Boston during 2019?
Question 2: Which are the neighborhoods with the most AirBNB stays in Boston?
Question 3: Which are the most expensive neighborhoods on AirBNB in Boston?
Question 4: What are the main features driving the price for AirBNB stays in Boston? Can prices for new stays can be predicted?

## File Description
This repository contains the required code in a Juypter notebook named "Code.ipynb" and the data files "calendar.csv", "reviews.csv" and
"listings.csv" of the Boston airbnb dataset.
